Please create a simple mockup signup page using forms and use JS 
functions to validate form inputs. (90%)
Please submit it on Canvas. 
NO email submission will be accepted.
You need pack resources into a package using zip or zar, and submit it on 
Canvas. DO NOT try to submit multiple files on Canvas.
NOTE: You are free to use any existing frameworks or templates. 
However, you need to make sure that all external resources if any are 
packed into the submission.
A. Your form should ask for the following information:
1. First name: must take a string without a number in it
2. Last name: must take a string without a number in it
E.g., wang11 -> should not be allowed.
3. Email: must be an email address
4. A sign-up page should have two buttons: sign-up and cancel. 
Here, the buttons must work. After clicking sign-up, the 
form should be validated. After clicking cancel, all values 
should be reset/removed from the form.
5. Every input should have a value. When the button is clicked 
and if some input field has no value, you should notify the user 
that that field does not have a value.
6. The above inputs must be input text fields (one-line text) and 
use JS code to verify every input field when the sign-up button 
is clicked and show error msgs on the web page to tell users 
whatâ€™s wrong. 
Disclaimer: Some of the validation may not make sense if you use other UI 
controls. However, the purpose of this homework is to test your knowledge 
on JS.
B. Aesthetics (5%)
You must use CSS to style your page and it looks polished (this is 
subjective, but you probably know what a good or bad website looks like.)
B. Better practices (5%)
Here, we will focus on the quality of your code
